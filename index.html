    <p>My name is Carter Jones and I am a senior AI and Music double major with a CS minor.
        I enjoy watching youtube, reading, biking, and working on my small homelab when I have
        free time. I work at an outdoors retail store and as a Drumline Instructor at a local 
        high school. I plan on attempting at getting a real job when I graduate (hopefully) and 
        have been considering law school. I'm fairly interested in intellectual property and the 
        legal aspects of that but also really like working with data.
