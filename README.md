## üìù Reflection

After completing this lab, write a few sentences about:
- What was the most challenging part?
- What did you learn about semantic HTML?
- How do you plan to expand this portfolio?

I found the most challenging part to be figuring out what to write. I realized a lot of my hobbies/interests are older and I don't have much time 
to do hobby stuff anymore. I am already fairly familiar with semantic HTML but this project just reminded me how tedious it can be at times writing 
all the tags. In class when we learned about Emmet Shortcuts, I was able to implement a lot of them immediately when building out the portfolio site.
I could expand the portfolio by adding existing projects that I have completed to the Projects page. I could add styling with css to make it more visually
and add even more specific pages. Potentially in the Hobbies page there could be another page linked that goes more in-depth on a specific interest.

*This portfolio will grow throughout the semester as you add React components and full-stack projects!*
