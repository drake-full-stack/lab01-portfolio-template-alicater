    <p>Majority of my hobbies are music, computer, or outdoor related.
        I enjoy biking and it's probably my preffered mode of transportation,
        I also really like a good hike. But probably my biggest "time consuming"
        hobbies are computer and music involved.
    </p>

    <h2>Computers</h2>
    <p>I currently have a small homelab running on a raspberry pi 4 and old Thinkpad.
        Right now I'm only running a NAS, pihole, and Jellyfin media server. I also
        enjoy working on smaller projects with SBC's. I've built a handheld block games console with
        an arduino, gutted an old laptop and put a raspberry pi in it, created a "smart mirror" with a pi, 
        and other smaller hobby projects. This past year I'd gotten a 3d printer to create housings easierly 
        for my projects as well.

    <p>I got a raspberry pi 5 past christmas that I've been able to use and work with!</p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>When I was younger especially, I used to really like music production stuff. I would create
        random beats and throw different effects on various track layers of a song. Most recently (though
        this is for my Music Major Thesis), I've been getting into the intricacies of sampling, both with
        tapes and digital means. I got into this kind of stuff more recently due to my interests in hip hop 
        and lofi. Someday I'd also like to get into turntablism.

    <p>Slightly unrelated to above, but this is probably one of my favorite tracks that has several samples in it.
        The story of Nujabes' Aruarian Dance is also super interesting if you ever want to go down a (short) rabbithole.
